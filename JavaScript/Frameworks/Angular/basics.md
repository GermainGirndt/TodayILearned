# Angular


### Service
In Angular, a service is an instance of a class that you can make available to any part of your application using Angular's dependency injection system.

### Components
Components define areas of responsibility in the user interface, or UI, that let you reuse sets of UI functionality. You've already built one with the product list component.

### Directives

*ngFor is a "structural directive". Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the elements to which they are attached. Directives with an asterisk, *, are structural directives.

### Template

The line, `{{ product.price | currency }}`, uses the currency pipe to transform product.price from a number to a currency string. A pipe is a way you can transform data in your HTML template.

Interpolation: {{ }}  
Property binding: [ ]  
Event binding: ( )  
Two-way Binding (banana in the box): [()]
