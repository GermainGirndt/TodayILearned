A repository with brief notes to programming.

## :eight_spoked_asterisk: Origins
On 11th May 2020 I decide to document my programming journey.  
  
**And this registry would serve to many purposes :dart::** 
* to be a reference database, which I could always rely on;
* to spare time on the long run instead of using google or stackoverflow to find answers to subjects which I've already learned;
* to help other people, who want use a similiar tool or understand a similar concept.
