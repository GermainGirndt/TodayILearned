# TodayILearned
A repository with brief notes to programming.

## Origins
On 11th May 2020 I decide to document my programming journey.  
And this registry would have many purposes: 
* to serve as a snippets database, which I could always rely on, as well as
* to spare time on the long run using google or stackoverflow to find answer to subjects which I've already learned.
