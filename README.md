# TodayILearned
A repository with brief notes to programming.

## Origins
On 11th May 2020 I decide to document my programming journey.  
  
And this registry would serve to many purposes: 
* to be a reference database, which I could always rely on;
* to spare time on the long run instead of using google or stackoverflow to find answers to subjects which I've already learned;
* to help other people, who want use a similiar tool or understand a similar concept.
