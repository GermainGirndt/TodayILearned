## Kubernetes vs Docker

They’re not competing technologies, but complete each other.

Docker offers containers, isolated environments for running applications. It’s mostly used for the running applications in the CI/CD. Container platform for building containers.

Kubernetes offers a infrastructures for managing them. It’s mostly used for automating the schedule and management of containers. Ecosystem for managing a cluster of docker containers.

Kubernetes is actually just comparable to docker swarm. K8s is more complex and has a bigger learning curve, but it offers more versatility.
